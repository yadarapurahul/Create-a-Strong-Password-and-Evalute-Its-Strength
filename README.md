# creating-strong-Password-and-evaluation

## Overview
By performing this task, you will learn how to:
- Generate strong and unique passwords
- Use free password strength evaluation tools
- Recognize factors that influence password security
- Understand brute force and dictionary attacks
- Apply best practices for password creation and management

## Tool Used
  - https://www.passwordmonster.com/
  - https://passwordmeter.com/
  - https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/
  - https://delinea.com/resources/password-strength-checker
  - https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/

## objective
To create multiple passwords with varying complexity, evaluate their strength using online password strength checkers and identify best practices for creating secure passwords.

## Description
This project demonstrates the process of designing strong passwords, testing them against password strength tools, and analyzing the results to understand how length, complexity, and randomness impact security. It also covers common password attacks and provides recommendations for improving password safety.

## Steps Followed
1. Created multiple passwords with varying complexity:
- Different lengths (8-16 characters)
- Combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols
2. Tested each password using:
  - https://www.passwordmonster.com/
  - https://passwordmeter.com/
  - https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/
  - https://delinea.com/resources/password-strength-checker
  - https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/
3. Recorded estimated time to crack and suggestions.
4. Researched common password attacks and security tips.

## Example Results (Sample Only—Not Real Passwords)
|Password Example|Length|Tool Used |Time to Crack|Feedback|
|----------------|------|----------|-------------|--------|
|**Pass1234**|8|PasswordMonster|0.01 Sec|Very weak, common word, simple numbers|
| **Rahul@143** | 9 | Bitwarden password | 13 hours | Weak, uses name and predictable numbers |
| **P₹īçåß$0** | 8 | howsecureismypasword | 23 years | Medium, complex but too short |
|**Darling€∆9**|10|Passwordmeter|17 hours|weak, dictionary word with symbols|
|**My$ecureP@ssw0rd**|14|delinea password|5 Trillion years|strong, long and complex, but pattern-based|

## Key Learning
- **Length matters**: Longer passwords are harder to crack.
- **Complexity matters: A mix of characters increases difficulty.
- **Avoid dictionary words: Easy targets for dictionary attacks.
- **Use MFA**: Multi-factor authentication adds extra security.
- **Password manager**: Helps store and generate strong passwords.

## Refers to password
- if you are commonly create ate passwords  your name, pet names, your favourite place, food, etc.
- From these things the hackers can crack password easily without any tools if the hacker knows you or your likes and dislikes
- Examples:
    - If you create a password like this, "Rahul@143," the hacker can easily crack the password. To avoid this, you can create a password like this: "R1æ9hü#4l@."

## Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force**: Tries every possible combination.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses lists of common words and phrases.
- **Phishing**: Tricks you into revealing your password.

## Best Practices
- Use at least 12-16 characters.
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- Avoid personal info (name, birthdate, etc.).
- Change password periodically.
- Use MFA whenever possible.
- Use a reputable password manager.
